### 1. Variables

A variable is a name for a value. It is used to store a value before it is executed in a function.
Letters or words are used to define variables. 
Functions are things that perform actions or calculate outputs(or both).

### 2. String Formatting
This is a python feature. It is commonly used to embed values stored in variables, inside strings.
f-string and format() are used for string formatting in Python.

### 3. Getting User Input
The input functions is useful in gaining user input and it can later be stored in a variabled and accessed through the print function. 
NOTE: Input functions by default outputs strings and you will need to extend it using int to convert the input into an integer and perform math operations.
