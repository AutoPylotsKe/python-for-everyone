x = 15

#What is happening here? - we want to store the value 15, in order to use it in future for an operation. 
#Alternatively, we expect the computer to remember that we stored the value 15 in a variable. So 15 is stored in variable x ...


#It is possible to store different data types in variables
y = 19.99 #Float
z = 20000 #Integer
a = "Hello World" #string - quotations here are used to identify strings. They are not entirely part of the contents, and are used as delimiters(marks the beginning and end of a data element in programming, files, or data streams.)
b = [1,2,3,4,5] #List
c = ("python", "java" , "javascript") # tuple
d = {"django", "springboot", "NodeJS"} #set

#Look out for the the data_type.py to see more about datatypes

#Example operation with variables
price = 9.99
discount = 0.2
result = price *(1 - discount) #BODMAS execution

print(result) #print function is used here to view the new value after execution of an operation.
